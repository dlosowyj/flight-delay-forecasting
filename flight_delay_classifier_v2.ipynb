    "# Flight Delay Classifier v2\n",
    "With the middling success of v1 (~68% accuracy for predicting delayed vs on-time), there is an opportunity to introduce more data in an effort to increase the accuracy of the model. Specifically, we will seek to incorporate weather data from the originating airport to the model. The logic is straightfowrard: our previous data was missing key information about the pre-flight conditions and adding them to the model will provide valuable data for a large chunk of delays (75% of delays > 15 minutes are due to weather https://www.afar.com/magazine/weather-conditions-affecting-flights-delays). \n",
    "\n",
    "The weather data was scraped from Weather Underground, namely the min, max, and average temperature, wind speed, and pressure along with total precipitation for each day that we have flight delay data. Our initial attempts will use these raw values, but we can also transform them as needed to include information such as \"snowing\" or \"windy\"."

    "## Considerations for Weather Features\n",
    "This new dataset has introduced a number of possible features that we should examine before including them (or not) in our model. The items of interest are:\n",
    "* Min, max, and average temperature\n",
    "* Min, max, and average wind speed\n",
    "* Min, max, and average pressure\n",
    "* Total precipitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going on our intuition, we can at least drop three of these items. Average temperature does not tell us anything significant that we do not already glean from the minimum and maximum temperatures. Similarly, the minimum wind speed will not have any impact on our model as the floor is 0 and we can safely say that no flight has been delayed due to calm conditions. Lastly, we can drop the average pressure using similar reasoning as for the average temperature. We really would only care about pressure changes (or extreme minimum pressures). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our remaining items all appear simple to work with--unimodal and with roughly normal distributions in most cases. The exceptions being WindSpeed_Avg, WindSpeed_Max, and PrecipitationTotal, which have relatively skewed distributions. We will make sure to normalize those as best we can in the data preparation steps."

    "We will proceed in a very similar line of data preparation as we did in v1, however, we will take advantage of some of our learnings. In this case, we will not be making use of the destination airport column. This adds a ton of features that did not exhibit much predictive power per our random forest classifier so we should avoid wasting processing power on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the data prepation steps we will undertake prior to classification are as follows:\n",
    "* Drop na values in 'Departure delay (Minutes)'.\n",
    "* Create a new column marking the flight as delayed (1) or on-time (0).\n",
    "* Convert the date and time to a day of the year and departure hour.\n",
    "* Drop unused columns.\n",
    "* Create a one hot encoder for the carrier code.\n",
    "* Write sine/cosine transformations of the day of year and departure hour.\n",
    "* Use min/max and robust scaling on the weather data.\n",
    "* Set up a pipeline to combine all the transformations."

    "Ultimately, it seems as though adding our weather data into the mix did not signifcantly improve the accuracy of our model. We still come in at 69.5%accuracy (a roughly .5% improvement over neural networks not given weather data). Interestingly, the weather data does come in just behind the date and time in terms of importance to the random forest, but far and away the strongest predictor is whether or not a flight is a Southwest Airlines flight. That feature ransk ahead of all others for importance in the random forest classification. This is not completely unexpected given the fact that Southwest Airlines is late significantly more often than other airlines. If the model simply guesses a Southwest Flight will be late, it will already hit a nearly 50% accuracy. How could weather data hope to compete with such a strong predictor??\n",
    "\n",
    "For next time, we will investigate if this trend holds at other airports. Will Southwest still be a strong predictor of delays? Or do airlines fair differently depending on their originating airport? Does weather have stronger predictive power at some airports than other? PDX has admittedly mild weather year round, but others like Denver can have powerful storms move in quickly around the mountains so maybe we will see stronger effects there."
