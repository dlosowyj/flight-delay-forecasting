    "# Flight Delay Classifier\n",
    "After working with flight_delay_model_v1, it seems that getting a reasonable estimate of the delay times from the destination airport, carrier code, and departure date/time is not entirely simple. We ended up with an RMSE of ~38 minutes so we are going to take a step back here and work to build a new model focusing on classifying flights into delayed or on-time. The hope with this new model is we can achieve some degree of useful information out while simplifying the project into a binary rather than continuous estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "Much of our approach will be identical to our approach with the random forest regressor. We will still be transforming the features via one hot encoding and sin/cosine functions, but we will no longer need to transform the labels as these will now be binary delayed (1) or on-time (0). There will also be a deeper dive into the effictiveness of this model through precision matrices and the precision/recall trade-off versus decision threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "For model selection, we will begin with a linear svc as it is amongst the simpler classifiers that we can use. From there, we can mildly complicate things with an SGD classifier before expanding into decision trees and neural networks, for the heck of it."

    "Now let's see how other, slightly more complex models do in handling this problem. We will go through:\n",
    "* SGD classifiers\n",
    "* Decision trees\n",
    "* Neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the decision tree will require some tuning that we skipped for the linear SVC and SGD classifier models. Ideally I would also tune the neural network, but I encountered some issues when implementing the grid search--namely that it could not find a suitable solution. I will come back to this to investigate more fully later, but, for now, we will stick with a double hidden layer with 25 nodes each.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should also point out that this notebook uses scikit-learn's MLPClassifier rather than PyTorch's implementation or TensorFlow's. This is chiefly a package manager limitation. PyTorch has discontinued its support for Anaconda (which this author uses) and TensorFlow is showing conflicts with my current environment. If scikit-learn's implementation proves effective, then I will create a new environment to use PyTorch."
