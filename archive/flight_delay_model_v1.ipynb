    "# Exploratory analysis take #1\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is a first pass at analyzing the flight delay data from a single airport (PDX) from January 1, 2021 through September 30, 2025 at 00:00:00. I expect some of my methods to be less than perfectly efficient at this stage, but the main goal is to get a handle on what kind of data I have and how to analyze it. Some open questions I have are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do I want to split the data? Stratified or purely random?\n",
    "* Should I pull data from a longer stretch?\n",
    "    * Note that I initially constrained this range due avoid interference from covid in the data and also to minimize the memory burden.\n",
    "* Will this data eventually benefit from supplementation with weather data or is the accuracy already sufficient with just the historical delay data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these bullet points, namely the last one, will likely not be answered in this notebook, but I want to keep it in mind nonetheless."

    "# Checking correlations\n",
    "Determining the attributes to use in our model will take two approaches: (1) correlation matrices and (2) grouped means/standard deviations. Correlation matrices will take care of continuous variables, but for categorical ones, I will compare the means (with standard deviations) of the departure delay when grouped by carrier code and destination airport. If there are large variations with either of these, then they will make useful predictive additions to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is very little to no correlation of the departure delay with day or time, which follows given PDX's relatively stable weather. While there is a slight donward trend for delay times at increasing departure hours, that is likely driven by the large number of flights leaving earlier in the day, which can be seen in the histogram farther down this notebook. In contrast, we see large variations in the average departure delays for different carriers and destination airports. For the purposes of this project, I will still include all of these attributes in the model as they will come in handy when the model is expanded to other airports where variations in weather throughout the year will likely cause delays."

    "Now I want to split the data up into training, cross validation, and test sets. Before that, I would like to consider how to split the data. Is it enough to simply split it into random units, or will that lead to underrepresentation of some of the data (e.g. some carriers be left out of the training/cv/test sets)? I will examine this issue through a quick look at a histogram of data by dates, scheduled departure times, carrier codes, and destination airports.\n",

    "# Encoding and scaling data\n",
    "With the attributes chosen, we must now encode the categorical variables and also scale the numerical ones. The categorical variables are handled simply enough with the OneHotEncoder, but the numerical variables will require different approaches for each. The delay times are quite skewed so we will take a three step approach: (1) make the values positive, (2) log transform them, (3) shift them to be centered and scaled aobut the median value. Meanwhile, we want to ensure that the cyclical nature of the departure time and departure day of the year are adequately captured by our model. We want 23:00 to be treated very similarly to 00:00 and similarly for day 1 and day 365. Trigonometric transforms with periods of 24 hours and 365 days, respectively, will solve those issues nicely for us."

    "\n",
    "It appears that our average error is 28 minutes across all the folds with very little variation between them (standard deviation of less than 1/2 a minute). Combined with the histogram of departure delay residuals from above (for only a single fold), it seems that our model produces most of its errors in the 0 to 100 minute range with some larger errors corresponding to the outliers in the data. We may be able to pull down the average error through some hyperparameter tuning."

    "# Hyper-parameter tuning\n",
    "Let's take a look at varying the max_features, max_depth, and n_estimators to see if we can improve the performance of our model. We'll use the RandomizedSearchCV for this to sample the space more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the hyperparameter tuning does not seem to contribute to any meaningfully improved results in terms of the rmse. The feature importances give some hints to this. It is chiefly the time of day and the day of the year that are influencing the delay time estimates. Carrier codes and airports initially appear to factor in, but these line up with the most frequent of each catergory, likely because these are given the most chances to be delayed. That is, having more flights to SEA does not give more chances to be not-delayed, but rather only gives additional chances to be delayed, which is what the model can see."

    "This first attempt does not give much promising in the way of estimating flight delays. An average error of 38 minutes tells us next to nothing about a flight's likely delay time, especially when the standard deviation of delay times is 39.7 minutes. What can we change? \n",
    "* Is a random forest regressor the right choice of model?\n",
    "    * We could be better served by a categorizer that determines if a flight will be dalayed or not rather than an estimate of the precise delay.\n",
    "* Are all of the attributes actually useful in this model?\n",
    "    * We can likely remove the destination airport and carrier codes to speed up model training and evaluation.\n",
    "* Does this generalize well to larger datasets? What about additional airports?\n",
    "    * It is possible that PDX is a strange microcosm of the US flight world in which estimating delays from this data is difficult or impossible. Looking at a broader range of origin airports could provide us access to more meaningful trends.\n",
    "* Did we overfit? Underfit?\n",
    "    * Plotting some learning curves would give us some nice insight to this issue.\n",
    "* Is there other data that could be useful here?\n",
    "    * While some flights are delayed due to issues like late cabin crews, which we don't have easily accessible data for, many flights are delayed due to weather. We could pull weather data for the origin and destination airports to correlate weather quality with delay time."
